I am an engineer with a strong passion for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science. Currently, I am pursuing my Master's in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning and Data Science. I am particularly intrigued by the potential of data to uncover insights, optimize processes, and inform better decision-making.

### 💼 Current Role

I am currently working as a Junior Engineer. I analyze production data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and develop analytical models to support FlexSim simulations. My goal is to optimize production line efficiency through data-driven solutions and continuous improvement.

### 🎓 Academic Background

- **Master's Student in Computer Science** at AGH University of Science and Technology (Currently enrolled)
- **Postgraduate Studies** in Machine Learning and Data Science at AGH University of Science and Technology
- **Bachelor of Computer Science in Engineering** at AGH University of Science and Technology

📄 **Engineering Thesis**: *Development of a model to analyze the influence of drawing temperature on the biological properties of biodegradable surgical wires made from ZnMg alloy*
